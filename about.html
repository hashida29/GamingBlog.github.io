    <p><b>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</b> is a mobile <a href="#" class="ptxt">multiplayer online battle arena</a> (MOBA) game developed and published by <a href="#" class="ptxt">Moonton</a>, a subsidiary of <a href="#" class="ptxt">ByteDance</a>. Released in 2016, the game grew in popularity; most prominently in <a href="#" class="ptxt">Southeast Asia</a>.</p>
    <p>At its core, the game pits 2 teams of 5 against each other in real time with at least 10-second matchmaking and 10-minute matches. Featuring traditional battle arena gameplay, players must fight over three lanes to take the enemy's tower and defend their own. Like classic MOBAs, there is no hero training to level up or pay to play angle—winners and losers are decided based on skill, ability, and strategy.</p>

                <p>Following success, Moonton has tapped into the esports scene with the creation of several regional tournaments dubbed as Mobile Legends: Bang Bang Professional League (MPL) that serves as a qualifier for the <a href="#" class="ptxt">Mobile Legends World Championships</a>. It was among the six games chosen for the first medal event of <a href="#" class="ptxt">esports</a> competition at the <a href="#" class="ptxt">2019 Southeast Asian Games</a> held in the Philippines.</p>
                <p>Originally named Mobile Legends: 5v5 MOBA, the initial release of the game in 2016 was met with criticism citing similarities with another MOBA game, <a href="#" class="ptxt">League of Legends</a>. As a result, <a href="#" class="ptxt">Riot Games</a> filed a lawsuit against Moonton for copyright infringement on two separate occasions: on July 2017 and May 2022. Moonton has since then made several remodeling and patch updates for distinction and game improvements.</p>

                    <p>After Moonton's staff of 20 finished developing its first game called Magic Rush: Heroes, released in 2015 to commercial success, they proceeded with developing the company's next project, a mobile <a href="#" class="ptxt">multiplayer online battle arena</a> (MOBA) game later titled Mobile Legends. The staff's experience with engineering Magic Rush: Heroes for a global market, such as customizing its features for the differing cultures and state of telecommunications of various countries, became beneficial for them to effectively design Mobile Legends as an appealing game for global players. Mobile Legends was released by Moonton with the subtitle "5v5 MOBA" on July 14, 2016. The game was distributed by Elex Tech in the United States. However, after the lawsuit from Riot Games in 2017, Moonton has removed the game from Google Play and re-released it as Mobile Legends: Bang Bang.</p>

                    <p>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang initially had 10 selectable characters, referred to as Heroes, upon its release in 2016. It later grew to 70 by November 2018, and as of December 2021, 112 heroes are in the live server.</p>
                    <p>With the game's popularity exponentially growing in Southeast Asia, Moonton has released several heroes based on actual people and characters from Southeast Asian histories and folklore to further increase the game's appeal, introducing heroes such as Lapu Lapu (Philippines), Minsitthar (based on Kyansittha; Myanmar), Kadita (based on Nyai Roro Kidul; Indonesia), and Badang (Malaysia).</p>
