    <p>The month of February is nearly over, and this month, we have seen a lot of skins and big events in Mobile Legends. The Valentine’s Day event and the Jujutsu Kaisen Collaboration are two of the best examples. MOONTON Games anticipates that many new items, heroes, skins, and a new rank system will be added to Mobile Legends in March. They have already released a lot of cool and exciting skins and events in the past year, and those who missed them will get another chance to grab them. The Starlight Pass will roll out in the game soon with unique rewards. In this article, we will discuss everything we know so far about the Mobile Legends leaks from March 2023.</p>

    <h1>Mobile Legends March 2023 Leaks: Upcoming skins</h1>

    <h2><b>Mobile Legends Starlight Pass for February 2023</b></h2>
    <p><b>Skin Rewards</b></p>

    <p>Mobile Legends Bang Bang is always focusing on skins that will give you a vibrant experience while playing, so for the month of March they are launching a special Valentina skin named CyberAgent. This skin will be in the Starlight category, and you can select its skin color, which is called Digital Enchantress. Both of the skins are very beautiful, each with their own unique animations. The Moonton Tech skin collection is more reminiscent of the CyberAgent skin collection.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, Valentina is in the meta at high ELO, and she is not only a mage; players are using her as a jungler/mage. In this perspective, if you spend money on her skin, you will definitely not regret it because she is not on the banned list. However, players would now no longer be able to choose their preferred skin from a series of four other skins. Besides, this new-design starlight would cost only 300 diamonds to buy, making it easier to get for most players.</p>

    <h2>Mobile Legends March 2023 Leaks: Upcoming events and skins</h2>

    <p><b>All-Star Event</b></p>

    <p>The following topic will be the All-Star game (Reserved String). MLBB is conducting a very big event, which will grant you lots of cool and exciting stuff. This event is mainly divided into five parts. You will learn about the events over time and receive free skins and emotes at the same time.</p>

    <img src="../images/news/news-img-allstarskins2.png" class="img-cover">

    <p>This will bring back some previous events like the <b>Promo Diamonds event</b>, <b>the Transformers event</b>, <b>and most importantly</b>, <b>the <a href="#" class="text-warning text-decoration-none">Guinevere</a> Legend skin</b> (Psion of Tomorrow) event, which are very interesting. So stay tuned to our page for more detailed information about draws and other tricks when it goes live. There is a chance of getting a free <b><a href="#" class="text-warning text-decoration-none">Rafaela</a> skin</b> in this event, so don’t forget to complete tasks on a daily basis.</p>

    <p>And it has also been confirmed that <a href="#" class="text-warning text-decoration-none"><b>Miya</b></a> and <a href="#" class="text-warning text-decoration-none"><b>Eudora</b></a> will receive the Allstar skins. Both animations are very eye soothing and have a flashy effect, and the amount of diamonds is not very high, so if you want to showcase your skin collection, you should definitely go for it.</p>

    <!-- S28 Season Skin -->

    <h2>S28 Season Skin</h2>

    <img src="../images/news/news-img-lapulapu-s28skin.png" class="img-cover">

    <p>At the end of this season, players will receive <a href="#" class="text-warning text-decoration-none"><b>Lapu-Lapu</b></a> Son of the Wild skin, but in order to get it you have to play 20 matches and then you can claim it. This skin animation will remind you of <a href="#" class="text-warning text-decoration-none"><b>Hilda</b></a>‘s basic skin entrance, the effects, and the design is very beautiful and in this skin, he looks like a Tribal Captain.</p>

    <h2>Moonlit Wish Epic Hanabi skin</h2>

    <img src="../images/news/news-img-hanabi-epicskin.png" class="img-cover">

    <p>In this month’s <a href="#" class="text-warning text-decoration-none"><b>Moonlit Wish</b></a> draw, we can get an epic skin of <a href="#" class="text-warning text-decoration-none"><b>Hanabi</b></a>, the skin design is decorated with lots of pedals. You can gather wishes which are capped at 200-1000. Finally, you will get the skin by opening the Moonlit crest. But here is a catch, if you don’t want that skin, there are so many different skin options present and you can easily choose between them.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Upcoming Epic Harith skin</h2>

    <p>Mage <a href="#" class="text-warning text-decoration-none"><b>Harith</b></a> will have an upcoming skin in March. Players are pretty excited about this skin because recently we saw that Harith was a massive pick in the regional champion games, and maybe that’s why developers decided to launch its skin. It will remind you of <a href="#" class="text-warning text-decoration-none"><b>Luo-Yi</a>‘s Tenko skin</b>.</p>

    <img src="../images/news/news-img-harith-epicskin.png" class="img-cover">

    <p>They are similar in that they both belong to the mage category and wear a <a href="#" class="text-warning text-decoration-none"><b>Kitsune Mask</b></a>, aka fox mask, which adds a pure Japanese Shinto festival vibe to the game. Our personal recommendation is that this is a must-buy skin for Harith Main.</p>
